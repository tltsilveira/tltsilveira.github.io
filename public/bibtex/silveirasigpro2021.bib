abstract = {Superpixels are fundamental in many visual computing applications, and most existing algorithms are designed to work with pinhole-based images. However, immersive applications are gaining visibility with the growing number of devices for capturing and visualizing 360∘ media. This paper introduces two fast and accurate superpixel algorithms tailored to the spherical domain. The methods are assessed under common figures of merit, and a benchmark annotated dataset. Additionally, an annotation-free evaluation metric for exploiting larger datasets is introduced. The methods introduced in this paper perform quantitatively close to or better than state-of-the-art approaches and are faster.}
